Juice-Maker-Machine
The Juice Maker Machine is an Arduino Mega 2560–based automated system developed as a first-year hardware project to solve the challenge of providing real-time, personalized beverage customization at events and gatherings. Instead of offering pre-made or one-size-fits-all juices, this machine empowers each user to select their preferred flavor and sweetness level through a keypad interface, and then autonomously prepares the drink by coordinating multiple electromechanical subsystems. It continuously monitors ingredient availability using sensors before dispensing, ensuring that the process only proceeds when the necessary components (such as flavor powder, sugar, and cup placement) are in place. Throughout the operation, feedback and status updates are shown on an I2C LCD, and critical alerts (like missing ingredients or placement errors) are communicated via a buzzer, making the user experience interactive and fault-aware.

The codebase integrates and orchestrates a variety of hardware modules: ultrasonic sensors for detecting correct cup placement, IR sensors for assessing powder levels (flavor and sugar), stepper motors and DC motors for mixing and dispensing, servo motors for precise juice distribution and drainage, relays for controlling pumps/valves, and a 4x4 matrix keypad for user input. The system logic includes checking chamber status, enabling user selection of juice parameters, actuating the appropriate motors to add ingredients, applying sauces or syrups via controlled valves, and final assembly with safeguards—such as verifying presence and readiness—before delivering the customized juice. Modular functions encapsulate each subsystem (e.g., distance measurement, motor stepping, servo control, and relay activation), making the architecture both readable and extensible.

Designed with scalability and real-world usability in mind, the Juice Maker Machine streamlines beverage service by reducing manual intervention, minimizing waste through sensor-driven checks, and offering consistent drink quality. Its structure supports future enhancements like expanded ingredient libraries, user profiles, remote ordering, and nutritional customization while keeping the core control logic intact. This project showcases a full-stack embedded system: from human-machine interaction (keypad + LCD), through sensing and decision-making (ultrasonics + IR + logic), to precise actuation (motors, servos, pumps) and user feedback (display, buzzer).
